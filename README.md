# StockExchangeClone

This is a clone of a currently ongoing live project whose original repository is currently private.
As the project is not yet complete, not all of the code has yet been implemented. 

**What is the project?**
This project is supposed to represent a basic Stock Exchange which receives buy and sell orders and performs order matching as fast as possible. The plan is to allow ~15 different orders for any stock from different sources to be executed concurrently and to minimize the down-time i.e. time when prices of stocks are being updated after an order.


**Files that have been implemented:**
- BankAccount Folder: All files
- Stock Folder: All files
- Tests Folder: BankAccountTests.cpp
